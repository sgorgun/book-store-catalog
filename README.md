# Book Store Catalog

Intermediate level task for practicing object-oriented design and class declaration.

Before starting with the task learn the basics of [UML language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language) and [UML Class Diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_diagram). Search YouTube for [relevant video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=uml+class+diagram) to get started quickly. Don't waste time! You don't have to master class diagrams. You just need to get a [basic understanding on the topic](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/object_oriented_analysis_design/ooad_uml_basic_notation.htm), and you can always find the answer to your question in the [UML Class Diagrams Reference](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/class-reference.html).

Estimated time to complete the task - 1.5h.

The task requires .NET 6 SDK installed.


## Task Description

In this task you have to implement few classes that represents a bookstore item. Each bookstore item has these attributes:
* A name of a book author.
* An [International Standard Name Identifier (ISNI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Name_Identifier) that uniquely identifies a book author (optional attribute).
* A book title.
* A name of a publisher who published a book.
* A book publication date.
* An [International Standard Book Number (ISBN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISBN) that uniquely identifies a publication.
* A book binding type.
* A book price.
* A currency of a book price.
* An amount of available books in a store.

Possible design of the class is shown on the class diagram below.

### Validation Rules

A book author name, a book title and a book publisher attributes must have at least one letter character.

A valid ISNI attribute must follow these rules:
* An ISNI code string must have sixteen characters.
* Each character is either a digit or "X" character (represents 10).

A valid ISBN attribute must follow these rules:
* An ISBN code string must have ten characters.
* Each character is either a digit or "X" character (represents 10).
* An [ISBN-10 checksum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISBN#ISBN-10_check_digits) is valid.

To calculate the ISBN-10 checksum, use this formula:

$`checksum = \sum_{i=1}^{10}(11-i)x_i=x_1·10+x_2·9+x_3·8+x_4·7+x_5·6+x_6·5+x_7·4+x_8·3+x_9·2+x_{10}·1`$,

where $`x_i`$ is the *i*th digit.

If the `checksum % 11` equals 0, then the given ISBN code is valid.

The currency attribute must follow these rules:
* A currency string must have three characters.
* Each character is a letter.

The price and amount attributes are valid, if an attribute value is greater or equals zero.


### Nullable Context

The [nullable annotation and warning contexts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/nullable-references#nullable-contexts) are disabled for both [BookStoreCatalog](BookStoreCatalog/BookStoreCatalog.csproj) and [BookStoreCatalog.Tests](BookStoreCatalog.Tests/BookStoreCatalog.Tests.csproj) projects.

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    ...
    <Nullable>disable</Nullable>
    ...
```

When a *nullable annotation context* is set to `disable`, the compiler behaves similarly to C# 7.3 and earlier:
* Nullable warnings are disabled.
* All reference type variables are [nullable reference types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/nullable-references).
* You can't declare a variable as a nullable reference type using the `?` suffix on the type.
* You can use the [null forgiving operator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/null-forgiving), `!`, but it has no effect.

Since the *nullable annotation context* is disabled, add [guard clauses](https://www.google.com/search?q=guard+clause) to your classes that will check input constructor and method arguments for `null`.

Use the invariant culture settings for string formatting.


### BookNumber Class

Implement a class that represents an ISBN.

Add a new [public](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/access-modifiers) class to the [BookNumber.cs](BookStoreCatalog/BookNumber.cs) file. The class must fulfill these requirements:

* Constructors
    * The class must have a public [parameterless constructor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/instance-constructors#parameterless-constructors) that must initialize a class object with default values. The default value for `amount` field is "0" and the default value for `currency` is "USD".
    * The class must have a constructor with `amount` and `currency` parameters. The constructor must validate the constructor arguments and initialize the `amount` and `currency` fields with the given arguments.
    * The constructor with parameters must use the `ThrowExceptionIfAmountIsNotValid` and `ThrowExceptionIfCurrencyIsNotValid` methods to validate the constructor arguments.
    * To remove the code duplication, use the [constructor chaining approach](https://www.google.com/search?q=constructor+chaining+in+c%23).
* Instance Methods
